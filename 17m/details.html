                    <p>Nepal's Beauty</p>
                    <p>Nepal, home to Mount Everest – the highest mountain in the world, may be a landlocked nation, but in terms of beauty, it is one of the most beautiful countries in South Asia if not in the world. It has, after all, been long known for its postcard mountains, Everest treks, water rafting rivers and paraglide-worthy skies. Next to that are the Durbar Squares, and so travelers are often wont to divide their travel intents and interests: should I go for the culture, or the adventure?
                        It’s very possible to do both, of course, without worrying about athletic capacity and cultural inclination. Indeed, all it takes is proper planning and looking in the right places to enjoy the best of Nepal’s worlds. In this itinerary, we begin in the capital of Kathmandu, with a throwback to the Malla reign and a number of sightseeing trips around the city and in nature. Midway through, an adrenaline-pumped journey will take you to Pokhara, where more of the outdoors(y challenges) await. Nepal is blessed with innumerable gifts of nature. The country has tremendous geographical and topological diversity that divides the country into Terai, Hilly, and Himalayan Regions.

                <p>Mountains</p>
                <p>If Nepal as a travel destination sounds underrated, that’s probably because it is – but only if you aren’t the outdoorsy, adventurous type.Nepal shares its borders with Tibet in the North, India in the South, East and West, separated from Bhutan by Sikkim, and from Bangladesh by Siliguri in West Bengal. Nepal is a country that is famous for its amazing Himalayan tapestry. The Mountains of Nepal are famous all over the world. With eight of the ten tallest mountain peaks lying within the nation, Nepal is a famous destination for mountain trekking and hiking journeys. With a diverse topography, Nepal has a wide variety of floral and faunal life residing within the country as well. The difference in the country’s climate and geography results in a variety of biomes where the heterogeneity of wildlife is flourishingly rich and diverse. Fertile plane lands occupy the southern region, isolated valleys located snugly amidst chartreuse hills are located between the southern and northern regions and the northern region is brimming with a mountainous topography that has many tall and magnificent mountain peaks in their acreage.  Mount Everest- the world’s tallest mountain peak also lies in the Khumbu region of Nepal. Because of its prominent mountains, Nepal is also the largest sovereign Himalayan state in the continent of Asia.

                    With many mountain peaks open for climbing and trekking expeditions, Nepal is visited by thousands of travelers every year. Many of the mountains of the country are also sacred to various local ethnic people and are unclimbed. Different in topography and climate, the southern Terai and the northern Himal present a unique geomorphology of Nepal. The Mountain Region (also called Parbat in Nepali) is situated at 4,000 meters or more above sea level to the north of the Hill Region. Constituting the central portion of the Himalayan range originating in the Pamirs, the mountain region of Nepal has a natural landscape that includes tall mountain peaks, amazing glaciers, mountain lakes and alpine vegetation situated amidst remote Himalayan villages and secluded settlements. In general, the snow line occurs between 5,000 and 5,500 meters. The region is characterized by an extremely cold climate, rugged topographic conditions, and human habitation with economic activities that are extremely limited and arduous. Indeed, the region is sparsely populated, and whatever farming activity exists is mostly confined to the low-lying valleys and the river basins, such as the Upper Kali Gandaki Valley as the frozen soils of the mountains are not suitable for farming.
                    
                    In the early 1990s, pastoralism and trading were the main economic activities of the mountain-dwelling people. Because of the climatic conditions and the lack of fertile soils for farming, the people of the mountain region relied heavily on trade and animal husbandry. Now, tourism has taken root in the mountains as the popularity and appeal of trekking have substantially increased. Before the tourism sector was commercialized in the mountains, herders used to move their Goth (temporary animal shelters) according to the seasonal climatic rhythms, and traders used to migrate seasonally between the highlands and the lowlands, buying and selling various goods.</p>

In fact, the lowest point in Nepal is 59 m above sea-level in the Tarai region while the highest point is Everest, 8,848 m above sea-level, the two points being only 200 kilometres apart as the crow flies. A majority of visitors to Nepal come in via the Tribuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. It is in Kathmandu that trekkers need to acquire their permits and other documentation, either from a trekking agent or from the appropriate offices. These documents will be checked along the trekking route. For those with little time on their hands, there are half-day hikes from Kathmandu to witness breathtaking Himalayan views.</p>
